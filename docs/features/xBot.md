# Goal
In order to get more eyeballs on our product, we need an AI Agent / Bot that posts 10-20 top holder analyses (based on birdeye trending) of memecoins per day to gain attention

# What needs to be done:
    - Decide on a framework (Eliza, Virtuals etc.)
    - Create logic and triggers of when the bot should post
    - Post on X based on a template (train AI to post like itâ€™s a human)

# Template
- Each post needs a sentence about whales activities and the ticker like "seeing whales aping $VINE"
- Add the token address
- Current Market Cap
- 24h Volume
- #whales detected
